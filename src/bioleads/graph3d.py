"""Rotatable 3D network rendering with Plotly.

pyvis (vis.js) is 2D only, so for a drag-to-rotate view we lay the graph out in
3D with a force-directed spring layout and draw it as Plotly Scatter3d traces:
one trace for the edges (lines) and one for the nodes (markers). The result is a
self-contained HTML file you can rotate, zoom, and hover.

Generic on purpose — both the entity co-occurrence graph and the paper citation
graph render through `write_graph_3d` with different size / color / hover hooks.

    ----------
    size_attr   node attribute used for marker size (e.g. "count").
    groups      {node: cluster_id} → discrete per-cluster colors (takes priority).
    color_attr  node attribute for a continuous colorscale when no `groups`.
    hover       callable(node, data)->str for the marker tooltip (HTML allowed).
    directed    annotate the title that edges are directed (A→B = A cites B).

    Returns None (with a warning) if Plotly isn't installed — the caller keeps
    its 2D output and the 3D view is simply skipped.
